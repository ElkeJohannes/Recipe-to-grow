    * When you click on the wrong shape, the game will end and you will be presented with a screen to submit your highscore. You can either choose to submit your score, after which you will be taken to the highscore screen, where there is a play again button:

        Or you can close the submit highscore screen using the (X) close button, in which case you can click on the default Play button:

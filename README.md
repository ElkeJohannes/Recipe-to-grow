## &rarr; **User Experience**

### **<ins>User stories</ins>**
As a non-contributing visitor to the site I want to:
  - view all available recipes
  - view the most popular recipes
  - view the most recently added recipes
As a contributing visitor to the site I want to:
  - add a recipe to the site
As the site owner I want to:
  - encourage users to add recipes
  - encourage users to also visit my plants webshop

### **<ins>Strategy</ins>**
The main purpose of the site is the sharing of plant-based recipes. The functionality to do so will be featured front and center to make it as easy as possible. Additionally the site will serve as a window, where plants the site owner sells on another website can be displayed. 

### **<ins>Scope</ins>**
The site will be feature adding, viewing, updating and deleting of recipes. Additionally users will be able to register and login. Plants for sale will be featured alongside the recipes. Users will only have a basic profile to change their password, and see the recipes they added.

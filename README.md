Recipe to grow is a website where users can share their favorite plant based recipes. Additionally, users can find links to products in my webshop (external site) for plants, that are appropriate to the recipe. 
--- Disclaimer: Data on the site, including seeds and plants, is dummy data. Recipes are copied from other sites and will be removed after succesful grading of the project.

## &rarr; **User Experience**

### **<ins>User stories</ins>**
As a non-contributing visitor to the site I want to:
  - view all available recipes
  - view the most popular recipes
  - view the most recently added recipes

As a contributing visitor to the site I want to:
  - add a recipe to the site
  - edit my own recipes
  - delete my recipes


### **<ins>Strategy</ins>**
The main purpose of the site is the sharing of plant-based recipes. The functionality to do so will be featured front and center to make it as easy as possible. Additionally the site will serve as a window, where plants the site owner sells on another website can be displayed. 

### **<ins>Scope</ins>**
The site will be feature adding, viewing, updating and deleting of own recipes. Additionally users will be able to register and login. Plants for sale will be featured alongside the recipes.

### **<ins>Structure</ins>**
 The main page will feature a button to immediatly take the visitor to all recipes. The menu will change depending on the logged-in status. The menu will be a hamburger meu on all sizes, and feature a drop down menu. The 'add recipe' and the 'edit recipe' pages are only accesible from the 'my recipes' page, all other pages are navigatable through the hamburger menu.

### **<ins>Skeleton</ins>**
The following wireframes were made using Balsamiq to give a rough idea of the project.
- [Home page](wireframes/home.png)
- [All recipes](wireframes/all_recipes.png)
- [Single recipe](wireframes/single_recipe.png)
- [Login](wireframes/login.png)
- [Register](wireframes/register.png)
- [Add recipe](wireframes/add_new_recipe.png)


### **<ins>Surface</ins>**
The page is designed around basic colours, mainly in the green spectrum. This is to emphasize the plant based nature of the site.

1. Created the project on Github. Git and Github were also used for the version control.
2. Created a new, empty app on Heroku
3. Linked the Github repository to the app
4. Created the Config Vars on the settings page of the app. In order to make the application work for yourself, ensure you create the following keys here:
   - SECRET_KEY (needed for Flash messages)
   - MONGO_DBNAME (your MongoDB database name)
   - MONGO_URI (the URI to your database)
5. From the deploy page, ran a manual deploy, after which, automatic deployment was enabled for the 'main' branch
